    "**Introduction** \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the transportation industry, there tends to be a unanimous opinion that electric vehicles are a healthier option for the environment due to their lack of tailpipe emissions. However, recent concerns have been drawn towards the indirect emissions caused by electric vehicles. The production of materials used for electric vehicles such as lithium-ion batteries is extremely environmentally detrimental. Additionally, electric vehicles must constantly charge their batteries with electricity straight from fossil-fuel consuming power grids. Despite these facts, almost all environmentalists agree that long-term fossil-fuel emissions caused by electric vehicles are significantly less than those of traditional vehicles. In our study, we are attempting to see if a relationship exists between the amount of electric vehicles and total amount of carbon emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prior Work** \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar studies have been conducted before, but only focus on the relationship between a single electric vehicle and its fossil fuel emissions. One such study in the U.S. by the Yale School of Environment (1) details that emissions from electricity and battery production pales in comparison to gasoline production use. This is believed to have been due to the U.S efforts to continually decarbonize its electricity supply with renewable energy. For this reason, some exports have expressed doubt about electric vehicle efficiency in areas with a less decarbonized electric grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2021 article from CNBC (2) seems to agree with the findings of the Yale School of Environment. The article summarizes several studies highlighting points of concern in relation to indirect emissions from electric vehicles. In terms of the efficiency of electricity and gasoline, the article cites one study determining that over its lifetime an electric vehicle produces a much lower carbon footprint than that of a traditional gas-powered vehicle. The article also highlights the fact that electric vehicles can only get more efficient with the increase of renewable energy. In terms of production, the article cites that producing electric vehicles is determined to be significantly more costly than producing petrol vehicles mostly due to the emission cost of producing lithium-ion batteries. However, the efficiency of electric vehicles is determined to be so superior that over time this deficit is offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these two articles present significant evidence to support a correlation between an electric vehicle and less carbon emissions, it does not fully answer our question. Developing new electric vehicles is very costly in terms of carbon emissions, and the influx of these new vehicles can definitely have a significant impact on the environment. Even though new electric vehicles are being produced does not mean gas-powered vehicles are being replaced. Additionally, another factor is that the majority of the U.S. power grid is still fossil-fuel powered. Until more of the grid becomes renewable energy a correlation of electric vehicle number and carbon emissions cannot completely be inferred.\n",

   "source": [
    "In our study, we hypothesized that there is indeed a relationship between the number of electric vehicles and total carbon emissions. In particular, we believe that the greater the number of electric vehicles in a state, the lower the number of total carbon emissions for that state. We base this hypothesis off of the evidence in support of electric vehicles lifetime efficacy versus that of gas-powered vehicles."

    "Our research is not intended to persuade/dissuade the purchase of electric vehicles and is not to be used for commercial purposes. However we cannot ensure that our research will not pose any influence on individuals who come across it, therefore we will do our best to use unbiased language and collect data from unbiased sources. The data we need to answer our research question does not compromise the privacy of any individual persons. Data on electric car sales and global car emissions are widely available to the public. One issue that could come up with our current research question is the possible assumptions that people could make based on our analysis findings. For example, a reader could assume that by finding evidence to support the claim of electric vehicle use decreasing the overall carbon emissions of cars we are implying that electric car use is a consequence free way to decrease our environmental impact. This is not the case as there are countless additional factors involved in electric car production that have their own negative impact on the environment. We will be doing an analysis strictly between the data we mention and our intention is to answer a question, not to make a point in support or opposition of electric vehicle use as a way to decrease carbon emissions. Another thing to note, is that there is always the concern of the organization that collected our data having their own biases and thus creating issues when analyzing the data. This should be known at the time of choosing our data source and should force us to discuss what any of these potential biases could be and to not use a given data set if we find one that brings any sort of ethics or privacy issues. This discussion of data sources should also extend to discussing the authenticity of the data. We need to do everything in our power to ensure our data is reliable and bias free before we begin any form of analysis."
