    "   - There are 16 different datasets corresponding to 16 different states. Each of these datasets contains over 1,000,000 EV observations that contain information from variables including the vehicle registration year and model. There are specifically 16 states because only 16 states have had their information made public through the Open Vehicle Registration Initiative. We hope to make our own single dataset from these 16 datasets. Our single custom dataset will have 16 observations for each of the 16 states. The goal is to create 10 variables for each year 2011-2020 which display the count of registered EVs and correspond these to the 16 observations corresponding to the documented states. \n",
