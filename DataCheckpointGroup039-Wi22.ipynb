Each of these datasets contains over 1,000,000 EV observations that contain information from variables including the vehicle registration year and model. There are specifically 16 states because only 16 states have had their information made public through the Open Vehicle Registration Initiative. We hope to make our own single dataset from these 16 datasets. Our single custom dataset will have 16 observations for each of the 16 states. The goal is to create 10 variables for each year 2011-2020 which display the count of registered EVs and correspond these to the 16 observations of the documented states. \n",

    "**Combining Datasets:** Our end goal is to have our own complete custom dataset which contains 128 observations. We choose 128 observations because we will have 16 states and 8 years ranging from 2011-2018 associated with each state. We choose 16 states because those states have the public EV registration data. We choose the years 2011-2018 because these years are commonly intersected among all datasets. Our variables will consist of the number of EVs registered, metric million tons of energy-related CO2 emissions, metric million tons of electricity energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, metric million tons of transportation energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, and proportion of renewable to total energy generated. Something to note is that the datasets of electricity energy-related carbon dioxide emissions and transportation energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are not directly related to the research question. However, we include them because we beleive they are will provide additional insight on a more specific level as to why or why not a relationship exists. We also include states' proportions of renewable to total energy generated as a potential confound variable if a relationship between number of electric vehicles and carbon emission count does exist."

    "The annual number of EVs registered by state data comes in the form of 16 datasets. Each one of these datasets corresponds to an individual state. The first step is to load all of the dataframes into a list. We know previously from visually looking at the datasets that none go before 2011 and none go past 2021. Based on the fact that our other datasets regarding CO2 emmisions range from 2000-2018, we determined to filter all of our data to the years 2011-2018. So, we iterate through each one of the datasets located in our list, calculated the value counts of electric vehicles registered per year from 2011 to 2018. This data is placed into our own custom datasets, and any data that is not complete from 2011-2018 is not included. We had an original target of 16 states, however, due to the fact that half of the states had incomplete data, we end up with 8. Our final dataset is a total of 8 states which have the counts of EVs registration from 2011-2018. Additionally, we store the number of EVs registered by model and year in a separete dataset in case we choose to use it later."

We start by renaming the columns into names that are readable. This is followed by splitting the dataset into two seperate datasets. One data set contains total electricity generated, while the other only contains forms of renewable electricty generated. We add together all the states' renewable energy amounts and then merge both data sets together. After this, a new column is added which calculates each state's proportion of renewable energy. We finish by filtering the dataset to the appropriate 8 states within the years 2011-2018. We are left with each of the targeted 8 states within the year range 2011-2018.
